        The first parameter to h1() (which is null in this case) is an object that specifies any properties 
        (think DOM attributes) that you want to pass to your component.

        The second parameter (" Hello World!" in this example) defines a child of the component.
        The simplest case is just a text child (a Text node in DOM-speak) as you see in the preceding code. 
        But you can have as many nested children as you like and you pass them as additional function parameters.
